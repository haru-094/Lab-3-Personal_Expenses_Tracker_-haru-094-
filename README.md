# 💰 Personal Expenses Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a command-line **Personal Finance Tracker** built using vanilla Python.  
It allows users to:

- Manage daily expenses  
- Track remaining balance  
- Generate expense reports  

Additionally, a companion **Shell script (`archive_expenses.sh`)** is provided to handle file organization, archiving, and automated searching of past records.

## 📂 File Structure
- `expenses-tracker.py` → Main Python application logic  
- `archive_expenses.sh` → Shell script for archiving and searching  
- `balance.txt` → Stores the current numerical balance

## 🖥️ Part 1: Python Application (`expenses-tracker.py`)

### Features

#### ✅ Check Remaining Balance
- Reads current funds from `balance.txt`
- Calculates total expenses and displays available balance
- Allows deposits (updates `balance.txt`)

- Prompts for Date (`YYYY-MM-DD`), Item Name, and Amount  
- Validates against available balance  
- Saves expenses into `expenses_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`  
- Updates balance automatically  

#### 🚪 Exit
- Gracefully terminates the program

## 🛠️ Part 2: Shell Script (`archive_expenses.sh`)

### Features
- **Directory Management** → Creates `archives/` folder if missing  
- **Archiving** → Moves daily expense files (`expenses_*.txt`) into `archives/`  
- **Logging** → Records archiving operations with timestamps in `archive_log.txt`  
- **Search Capability** → Search archives by date (e.g., `2024-11-07`) and display file contents
